### FYS-STK4155 Project 2

This repository contains the code and data for the second project of the course. It is structured as follows:

 - [lin_reg.py](lin_reg.py): contains the code associated to the gradient optimizers for OLS and Ridge regression.
 - [log_reg.py](log_reg.py): contains the code associated to the implementation of logistic regression.
 - [nn.py](nn.py): contans the code associated to the implementation of the neural network.
 - [run_part1.py](run_part1.py): contains the code for comparing the different gradient optimizers.
 - [run_part2.py](run_part2.py): contains the code for testing the neural network on the regression dataset.
 - [run_part3.py](run_part3.py): contains the code for testing the neural network on the classification dataset.
 - [run_part4.py](run_part4.py): contains the code for testing the logistic regression implementation.
 - [wdbc.csv](wdbc.csv): the data of the Wisconsin breast cancer dataset.

In the code we make use of the _numpy_ and _autograd_ libraries. For plotting we further utilize _matplotlib_.
